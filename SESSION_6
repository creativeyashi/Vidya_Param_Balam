Interview Tips:


1) Do not follow the old method of giving the intro  (Important)

Tech interview
1) test cases clear
2) Observations bullets
3) use observations to give diff solutions
4) if code required make sure to write clean code


Project interview

1) projects in your resume
2) never write any resume which you have not done
3) projects descending -> project which is best should be on top
4) techstack, think about (brainstorming)
5) if you have blindly followed a practice -> false anwsers -> no debate -> take care of next time

HR interview
1) never be blunt with HR
2) what will be the ctc? -> experience


Tech-

Given an array of integers remove the duplicate integers

Test cases: -1 -2 -4 0 -1 2 4 -2
Output - -4 -2 -1 0 2 4

O(nlogn) - bar 
0(n) - count sort -> extra space -> range too high cannot be used 1- 10^6

Observations: 
1) Sorting needs be done
2) Sort input or i used a dats structure to sort

-4 -2 -2 -1 -1 0 2 4


Data structure -> sorted set -> set is a ds to store unique elements
{0 1 2 3}

TreeSet -> traverse to get output    //for c++ can use Set<int>s;

TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<Integer>

for(int i : arr){
	set.add(i)
}

Solutions:

Method 1 - 2 - For
				loop 1 - arr[i]
        loop2 - arr[i+1]
        SC - O(1)
        
Method 2 - nlogn
					arr[i] == arr[i+1]
          SC- O(n)
          
method 3 - hashset 
	  
	  Sc - O(n)
